## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Handover offer when the assistant keeps hammering at one tool or keeps failing, on every
  channel through the Hermes gateway.
- Two handover modes: `ask` (default, nothing sent until the owner answers) and `auto` (the
  installation's own model writes the dossier, the plugin files it over MCP and sends the
  approval link).
- Offer after Hermes' own loop guardrail halts a turn, sent through the gateway after Hermes'
  halt message.
- Per-installation settings, `threshold` (default 6) and `handover`, read on every reply;
  changed with `hermes senzu setup`, `hermes config set`, or the `senzu_settings` tool the
  assistant calls when its owner asks.
- Critical-action gate on Hermes' native approval prompt, with per-family `rule_key`s.
- `hermes senzu setup` to connect the Senzu MCP server and pick the mode, `hermes senzu doctor`
  to check the installation.
